<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px">💖Information about the app😀</h2>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; text-align: center; font-size: 20px">
    This application aims to be a complete assistant for people engaged in agricultural work, 
    specifically with field spraying. The application enables users to enter their fields along 
    with some important information about them on the map. It also enables users to know which fields 
    are organically farmed and which are not. That is, which fields can be sprayed and which can not. 
    There are two main roles in the application, the first is the Owner who will enter his fields on the map. 
    The application also distinguishes the role of the Spray worker, who will spray the fields to combat pests.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px">😎Technologies used🌎</h2>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; text-align: center; font-size: 20px">
    The app is only available at the moment for android devices, so for the development of the app
    I have used Java alongside with his IDE that is called Android Studio.
    I have used Firestore for storing the date of the app. Firestore is a no-SQL database developed 
    by Google. Also, I use the Authentication module that Google provide to authenticate the users 
    with their Google account but also with accounts from another provider, if they have.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; text-align: center; font-size: 20px">
    In the folder ./App you can find the apk file of the app. You can test and use the app

    Studio and then the app will be installed on your phone. You can also use the emulator of Android
